# :page_facing_up: Code Documentation 
## Importing Needed Libraries
The following are the libraries used in the code:
- Numerical Python
- Matplotlib
- Python Data Analysis
- Seaborn
> :exclamation: Note: Import all libraries at the start of the code to improve code readability and prevent import issues
```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
import pandas as pd
```
# Overview of Dataset
## Importing the dataset
> :exclamation:The Spotify Dataset Used in this project is also uploaded in this repository

To import the CSV file, use ```python pd.load_csv()``` 
``` python
dataset = pd.read_csv('SpotifyData2023.csv')
dataset
```
- Throughout this code the variable name 'dataset' will be used to refer original csv file
## Determining the number of rows and columns
Use the ```.shape()``` command in order get the values of its rows and columns 
``` python
#Obtain the number of rows and columns from the dataset and assign it to a variable
rows, columns = dataset.shape
```
``` python
#Print the number of Rows and Columns
print('Number of Rows:',rows)
print('Number of Columns:',columns)
```
#### Expected Result:
```python
Number of Rows: 953
Number of Columns: 24
```

## :part_alternation_mark: Determining the Missing Values and Data Types
### Missing Values
- In order to calculate the count of missing values for each column in the dataset, we need to determine the total number of NaN (Not a Number) elements in the dataset
- The command '.isnull' can be used to determine if an elemenet in a dataframe is NaN
### :exclamation: Data Type Issue
- By observing the given spotify csv file, it can be seen that at the column 'streams' there is one data which is a string
 <div align="center">
 <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7cb94ed8-312c-4eaa-bb16-1e5f4f74c0a3" alt="Spotify CSV observation" width="500" height="300">
  </div>
  
- To properly count number of Missing Values, change the string into a NaN value
``` python
dataset['streams'] = pd.to_numeric(dataset['streams'], errors='coerce')
```
- Calculate the count of missing values for each column in the dataset
``` python
missingval_count = dataset.isnull().sum().reset_index()
```
- Change column names for better presentation of table
``` python
missingval_count.columns=['Columns', 'Missing_Value']
```
- Display the missing values count and limit the number of printed results to not clutter up the terminal
``` python
print('Missing values per column:')
print('\n',missingval_count.head(10))
```
#### Expected Result 
<div align="center">
  
    Missing values per column:
    
                     Columns  Missing_Value
    0            track_name              0
    1        artist(s)_name              0

    3         released_year              0
    4        released_month              0
    5          released_day              0
    6  in_spotify_playlists              0
    7     in_spotify_charts              0

## Data Wrangling

- To properly utilize the data from the spotify dataset, the data set must be manipulated in order to interpret and extract useful data
- **Problems with the Dataset**
  - **Missing Value Columns** - replace NaN values with 0 using command '.fillna()
  - **Columns with numbers** - replace values containing strings and change datatype into integers

 -  Replace missing values with 0
 ```python
dataset.fillna(0, inplace=True)  # The inplace=True modifies the DataFrame in place
```
- Replace values with commas and change data type into integer
 ```python
dataset['in_deezer_playlists'] = dataset['in_deezer_playlists'].astype(str).str.replace(',', '').fillna(0).astype(float).astype(int)
dataset['in_shazam_charts'] = dataset['in_shazam_charts'].astype(str).str.replace(',', '').fillna(0).astype(float).astype(int)
```
# üî¥Summary and Insights of Overview of Dataset
:purple_circle: In total it was found that the number of rows in the dataset was found to be 953 rows and the total number of columns was found to be 24. In addition the dataset was found to have three data types which include integers, floats, and strings. After looking at the dataset, it was also found that there are a number of missing values. Based on the data, the column with highest number of missing value was 'keys', followed by 'in_shazam_charts'. With relation to this the highest amount of missing data type as integers which corresponds to the high number of missing 'in_shazam_charts' values then followed by strings. 

‚ùó In addition, to improve compatibility of the dataset, you might have to convert the file type in order to be properly called within the python code.

# üî¥ Summary of Basic Descriptive Statistics

üü£ The average number of streams in this dataset is approximately 513.6 million. This value indicates the central tendency of track popularity across all songs. The median number of streams, at 290.2 million, provides the midpoint of the data, showing that half of the tracks have fewer than this number of streams, while the other half have more. The standard deviation of streams is 566.8 million, reflecting substantial variability in track popularity, with some tracks significantly outperforming others in terms of stream count. This high standard deviation suggests that a few tracks might have exceptionally high stream counts, creating a wide range in the dataset. It was found that as the years passes by, the number tracks increased dramatically. Specifically, there is a big spike in the increase number of tracks starting around the year 2020. As for the Artist Count, it was found that the lesser number of Artist work on a track, the higher of number of tracks are produced. This implies that most Artists and Musicians prefers to work alone or be much more efficient in releasing tracks. 



## Top Performers

- To determine the track that has the highest number of streams, we can use **<span style="background-color: #FFDFD3; color: black">'.sort_values'</span>** command
- Sort the dataset values by streams in descending order 
```python
ascdataset = dataset.sort_values(by='streams',ascending=False)
```
- Display the top 5 most streamed tracks
```python
ascdataset = ascdataset.head(5)
```
- Slice only 'track_name', 'artist(s)_name', 'streams'
```python
ascdataset[['track_name', 'artist(s)_name', 'streams']]
```

# üî¥ Summary of Temporal Trends
:purple_circle: The analysis of track releases over time shows a clear upward trend, with a notable surge in recent years. Specifically, from 2021 to 2023, there was a significant increase in the number of tracks released. The peak occurred in 2022, with 402 songs released, followed by 2023 with 175. This rise likely reflects a growing trend in music production and more frequent releases in the age of the internet. Looking at monthly release patterns, January and May emerge as the months with the highest release counts, with January seeing around 134 songs and May slightly more. While there is some variation in releases across other months, these two months consistently have higher numbers, suggesting possible seasonal trends or intentional release strategies by artists and labels.

# Summary of Genre and Music Characteristics
üü£ The correlation analysis between streams and musical attributes, such as BPM, danceability, and energy reveals minimal influence of these factors on streaming popularity. Specifically, BPM has a correlation of approximately -0.002 with streams, indicating almost no relationship between a song‚Äôs tempo and its popularity. Danceability shows a slightly stronger correlation with streams at -0.104, though this relationship remains weak, suggesting that danceability does not significantly affect stream counts. Energy has a correlation of around -0.026 with streams, similarly showing negligible influence. Among these attributes, danceability has the highest correlation with streams, but it is still too weak to suggest a meaningful impact on a song‚Äôs popularity. 

üü£ Exploring correlations between other musical attributes, danceability and energy display a moderate positive correlation of 0.198, indicating that tracks with higher danceability tend to have higher energy. Additionally, valence and acousticness exhibit a stronger negative correlation of -0.819, suggesting that tracks with a happier sound (higher valence) are generally less acoustic. These correlations highlight some internal relationships between musical characteristics, but none of them have a substantial effect on streaming numbers.

## Platform Popularity

- To calculate total number of tracks per platforms' playlist/chart the command .sum() can be used
- **.sum()** - enables user to be able to get the total values of the column
- **Syntax** = varname = dataframe[platformtlist/chart].sum()

- Get the sum of the specified columns
```python
spotplaylist = dataset['in_spotify_playlists'].sum()
spotcharts = dataset['in_spotify_charts'].sum()
appleplaylist = dataset['in_apple_playlists'].sum()
```
- Print the values
```python
print('Number of Tracks in spotify_playlists:',spotplaylist)
print('\nNumber of Tracks in spotify_charts:', spotcharts)
print('\nNumber of Tracks in apple_playlists:',appleplaylist)
```
- Get the sum of the specified columns
```python
applecharts = dataset['in_apple_charts'].sum()
deezerlist = dataset['in_deezer_playlists'].sum()
deezercharts = dataset['in_deezer_charts'].sum()
```
- Total the data from charts and playlist for each platfotm
```python
appletotal = applecharts + appleplaylist
deezertotal = deezercharts + deezerlist 
spotifytotal = spotplaylist + spotcharts
shazamtotal= dataset['in_shazam_charts'].sum()
```
- Print results
```python
print('\n\nNumber of Tracks in Apple is:',appletotal)
print('\nNumber of Tracks in Deezer is:', deezertotal)
print('\nNumber of Tracks in Spotify is:', spotifytotal)
print('\nNumber of Tracks in Shazam is:', shazamtotal)
```
#### Expected Results

    Number of Tracks in spotify_playlists: 4955719
    
    Number of Tracks in spotify_charts: 11445
    
    Number of Tracks in apple_playlists: 64625
    
    
    Number of Tracks in Apple is: 114094
    
    Number of Tracks in Deezer is: 369625
    
    Number of Tracks in Spotify is: 4967164
    
    Number of Tracks in Shazam is: 54176


## Plotting the number of tracks in Spotify Playlist, Spotify Charts, and Apple Playlist

```python
playlist_counts = {'Spotify Playlists': spotplaylist,'Spotify Charts': spotcharts,'Apple Playlists': appleplaylist}
```
- Configure the figure size
```python
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
```
- Create a bar plot of the data
```python
sns.barplot(x=list(playlist_counts.keys()), y=list(playlist_counts.values()), palette='Blues',hue=list(playlist_counts.keys()))
```
- Format the labels and titles of the plot
```python
plt.xlabel('Playlist/Chart Type')
plt.ylabel('Number of Tracks')
plt.title('Number of Tracks in Spotify Playlists, Spotify Charts, and Apple Playlists')
plt.tight_layout()

# üî¥ Summary of Platform Popularity
:purple_circle: The comparison between the number of tracks in spotify_playlists, spotify_charts, and apple_playlists shows notable differences in how these platforms curate and feature songs. The spotify_playlists category has the highest number of tracks, with approximately 4955719 tracks, indicating that Spotify playlists have a wide variety of songs available. Apple Playlists, with 64625 tracks, contain fewer entries, suggesting a more selective curation compared to Spotify‚Äôs playlists. Meanwhile, spotify_charts have only 11445 tracks, representing the most popular and trending songs on Spotify at any given time.

Given these numbers, it appears that Spotify playlists include a more extensive selection of music, whereas Spotify charts favor the most popular tracks due to their relatively smaller, curated list focused on current trends and hits. This suggests that Spotify may provide broader exposure for both mainstream and niche songs through its playlists, while Spotify charts specifically highlight the most popular tracks.

## Advanced Analysis

- create a dataset that contains'in_spotify_playlists', 'in_spotify_charts', 'in_apple_playlists', 'in_apple_charts', 'in_deezer_playlists', 'in_deezer_charts', 'in_shazam_charts'
```python
columns_track = ['in_spotify_playlists', 'in_spotify_charts', 'in_apple_playlists', 'in_apple_charts', 'in_deezer_playlists', 'in_deezer_charts', 'in_shazam_charts']
```
- Calculate the sum for each row across the specified columns and create a new column
```python
dataset['total_appearances'] = dataset[columns_track ].sum(axis=1)
```
- Group by key and mode and calculate the total track count, playlist/chart count, and streams
```python
spotify_summary = dataset.groupby(['key', 'mode']).agg(total_tracks=('track_name', 'size'),total_playlist_chart_count=('total_appearances', 'sum'),total_streams=('streams', 'sum')).reset_index()
```
- print results
```python
print(spotify_summary.head())
print('\n',spotify_summary.tail())
```
